To use this currency converter, you can pass two GET parameters ```to``` and ```from```, which represent the currencies you want to convert from and to. By default, the converter uses PLN (Polish z≈Çoty) as the base currency, but you can change it by passing a ```amount``` parameter.


For example, to convert 100 USD to EUR, you can use the following URL:
```

```
